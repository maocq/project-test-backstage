# Use Output Variables to Query Data in AWS Using Terraform

## Introduction

Hey there, Gurus! Welcome to the lab! This lab will demonstrate the usefulness of output variables and how they can be used to collect useful data about resources in your infrastructure. In this lab, we will first deploy the lab environment, then we will add some output variables to output the instance name and its IP. Let's get started!

## Solution

Log in to the terminal using the credentials provided for the lab:

`ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>`
